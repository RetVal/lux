package sprite

//notes:
/*
first load all tiles into a texture, but literally like 1 so we dont have to switch every freaking tile

next have another texture about how the shit works

plug that into a geo shader

render the shit out of it
DONE!


opt:
then some other crap about camera and rendering only what you see (and thats what youll get)
